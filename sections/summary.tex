Sebastian Lapuschkin is the Head oif the Explainable Artificial Intelligence research group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI) in Berlin.

He received his Ph.D. degree with distinction from the Berlin Institute of Technology in 2018
for his pioneering contributions to the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning.
From 2007 to 2013 he studied computer science (B. Sc. and M. Sc.) at the Berlin Institute of Technology,
with a focus on software engineering and machine learning.

Sebastian is the recipient of multiple awards, including the Hugo-Geiger-Prize for outstanding doctoral achievement and the 2020 Pattern Recognition Best Paper Award.

His work is focused on pushing the boundaries of XAI, e.g, for achieving human-understandable explanations,
and towards the effective and efficient utilization of interpretable feedback for the improvement of machine learning systems and data.

Further research interests include efficient machine learning and data analysis, as well as data and algorithm visualization.
