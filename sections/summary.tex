Sebastian Lapuschkin received the Ph.D. degree with distinction from the Berlin Institute of Technology in 2018
for his pioneering contributions to the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning.
From 2007 to 2013 he studied computer science (B. Sc. and M. Sc.) at the Berlin Institute of Technology,
with a focus on software engineering and machine learning.

Since 2021, he is the Head of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI) in Berlin.

He is the recipient of multiple awards, including the Hugo-Geiger-Prize for outstanding doctoral achievement and the 2020 Pattern Recognition Best Paper Award.

His work is focused on pushing the boundaries of XAI, e.g, for achieving human-understandable explanations, and towards the effective utilization of interpretable feedback for the improvement of machine learning systems and data.
Further research interests include efficient machine learning and data analysis,  as well as data and algorithm visualization.

Sebastian changed his last name in marriage in 2016 and is father to a son born in the same year.
