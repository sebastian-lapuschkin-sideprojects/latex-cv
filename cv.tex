Sebastian received the Dr.\ rer.\ nat.\ (PhD) degree with distinction (``summa cum laude'') from the Berlin Institute of Technology in 2018.
From 2007 to 2013 he studied computer science (B.\ Sc.\ and M.\ Sc.) at the Berlin Institute of Technology, with a focus on software engineering and machine learning.
Currently, he is a tenured researcher at the machine learning group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI) in Berlin.
His research interests include computer vision, (efficient) machine learning and data analysis,
data and algorithm visualization, and the interpretation, \mbox{(meta-)}analysis and rectification of machine learning system behavior.
Sebastian loves automation and woodland hiking (not simultaneously).

%Besides his professional endeavours, Sebastian enjoys automating repeating office work
